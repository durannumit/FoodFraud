# FoodFraud
A flutter app for publishing companies and products that published by Ministry of Agriculture of Turkey

This simple app demonstrates usage of Firebase Realtime DB

To be able to build and run this project `google-services.json` file needs to be placed under  `android/app` and `constants.dart` file needs to be under `lib` with following parameters 
```
const firebaseDbURL = "";  
const iosGoogleAppId = "";  
const iosGcmSenderId = "";  
const androidGoogleAppId = "";  
const androidGoogleApiKey = "";
```
you can get the `google-services.json` file and the contents of the `constants.dart` file from firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/) or request from `oshamahue at gmail` (no guarantees for support)

Firebase Realtime DB could be initialized with `food-report-export.json` file the contents of this file is not complete and will be completed by the time.
